# CS 412 - Machine Learning

**Course Description:** The course aims a solid understanding of the fundamental issues in machine learning (overfitting, bias/variance), together with several state-of-art approaches such as decision trees, linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, Bayesian classifiers, neural networks, logistic regression, and classifier combination. In addition to supervised approaches, unsupervised approaches are covered, and model evaluations strategies are introduced for different tasks.
